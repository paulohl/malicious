# ATTENTION: malicious Software from suspicious eMail address

### Received via eMail and disected 
### Intercepted hacker attack

## Introduction: disecting the received HTM file

_The code seems to be obfuscated and potentially malicious_. Breaking it down:
- The HTML document starts with the usual structure.
- There's a <script> element in the body of the document. Inside, it seems like _the script is decoding some base64 encoded strings and creating <script> elements dynamically_.
- The **atob()** function is used to decode base64 encoded strings.
- The script retrieves an attribute value from an element and decodes it using **atob()**. It then _constructs a <script> element_ with certain attributes _and appends it to the <head> element_.
- There's another similar operation performed in the script where it constructs another <script> element and appends it to the <head> element.

_Breakdown of the suspicious parts_:

* The **atob()** function _is commonly used to decode base64 encoded strings_. It's **often used by malicious actors to obfuscate their code and hide its true purpose**.
* The _dynamically created <script> elements are being appended to the <head> element_. This _allows the script to potentially execute arbitrary code retrieved from remote sources_.
* The presence of encoded strings and dynamically generated script elements suggests that this code may be attempting to load and execute additional scripts from remote servers. 
    * This is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection and execute unauthorized actions on the user's browser.
* In summary, **without knowing the intent behind the decoded strings**, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose of this code. 
* The dynamic creation of script elements and the decoding of base64 encoded strings are **common techniques used in malicious scripts**. 
* It's advisable to avoid executing such code and to inspect and sanitize any HTML and JavaScript code received from untrusted sources.

##Analyzing the files after decoding the base64 strings and downloading all hidden calls

* Original HTM document contains personalized information, including my personal email address (ph@zinnia.holdings) and a URL **(https://sithchibb.com) [^1] **. 
    * The encoded string in the sti attribute (USER09022024UNIQUE0217020924202420240209170224) appears to be some form of unique identifier or token, which may have been generated for tracking or authentication purposes.

> ** [^1] https://sithchibb.com** is a domain tagged as suspicious with a blank home page and a tiny error message at the top left. 

* The JavaScript code within the <script> tag dynamically loads two JavaScript files based on the decoded URL (sss_api):
    * The first JavaScript file is "js.js".
    * The second JavaScript file is "/socket.io/socket.io.js".

While the HTML document itself may not contain obvious malicious content, the presence of personalized information and the dynamic loading of JavaScript files could be indicative of a phishing attempt or a malicious script injection. ** It's important to exercise caution when dealing with such content, especially if it was received unexpectedly or from an unknown source **.

### Recommended actions:

**Do Not Execute the JavaScript**: Avoid running or executing the JavaScript code contained within the HTM document, especially if suspected it may be malicious.

**Scan for Malware**: Use reputable antivirus or antimalware software to scan the system for any potential threats or malicious files.

**Report Suspicious Activity**: If suspected that the HTM document or its contents are part of a _phishing attempt_ or _malicious activity_, report it (email provider. ISP) and consider notifying relevant security authorities (and organization's IT security team if applicable).

**Exercise Caution with Personal Information**: Be cautious about sharing personal information, such as your email address, especially in unsolicited communications or unknown contexts.

**Stay Informed**: Stay informed about common phishing techniques and best practices for cybersecurity to better protect yourself from potential threats in the future.

Staying vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Help mitigate the risks associated with suspicious or potentially malicious content.
